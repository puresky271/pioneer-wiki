# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Production image for Pioneer Wiki. Three stages share one build:
#
#   deps    -> pnpm install --frozen-lockfile against the committed lockfile
#   builder -> `next build` with NEXT_STANDALONE=true, which emits the
#              self-contained server in `.next/standalone` (see next.config.ts)
#   runner  -> the standalone server, no package installation, non-root
#
# `tools` is the builder plus a shell, for the one-off seed and admin-bootstrap
# commands that need the Supabase service-role key.
#
# Supabase settings are read from the environment at request time, not inlined
# by the build, so one image runs against mock fixtures or any Supabase project.
# That holds while no client component reads the Supabase env; if one ever does,
# the URL and anon key must become build arguments instead.
